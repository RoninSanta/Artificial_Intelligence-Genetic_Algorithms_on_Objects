# AI-Genetic_Algorithms_Python
### Testing effects of genetic algorithm to create an object that can walk without user interference 
[A Python script I created an AI algorithm that can evolve and improve its capabilities by itself using ``Genetic Algorithms``]
A graph was generated to visualize the relationship between the number of generations and the mean fitness of the population(How well each generation performed)
- The AI is able to self correct itself after each generation and slowly gets better at walking/ moving
- ALL of it done without any human interference or adjusting
- Achieved results after only **100 generations**

``[Increased Segment Length]``
- It realised that increasing the length will give it leverage

``[Final iteration]``
- Final result, __Added Roundness__ , __Added Length__, __Breaking Physics Engine to move faster__
